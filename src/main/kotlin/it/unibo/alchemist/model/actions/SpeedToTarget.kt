/**
 * An action that moves a node towards a dynamically computed target at a speed determined by node properties.
 *
 * This action uses a straight-line routing strategy, a target computed from node molecules, and a speed
 * determined by the node's velocity and reaction. The movement is interpolated to ensure the node does not
 * exceed its allowed movement per step.
 *
 * @param T the type of the concentrations in the environment
 * @param P the type of position used in the environment
 * @property environment the environment in which the node moves
 * @property node the node to move
 * @property reaction the reaction associated with the node
