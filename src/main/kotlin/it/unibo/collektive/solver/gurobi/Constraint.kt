/**
 * A handle to variables and constraints that have been structurally installed into a [GRBModel] **exactly once**.
 *
 * After [ControlFunction.install] returns this handle, the model topology is frozen.
 * Every ADMM iteration must only call [update] to refresh numerical parameters (RHS, linear coefficients,
 * variable bounds) and then call [GRBModel.update] once before [GRBModel.optimize].
 *
 * Gurobi's [GRBModel.addVar] / [GRBModel.addConstr] are comparatively expensive: they allocate
 * internal data structures and require a full model rebuild on every [GRBModel.update] call.
 * [GRBModel.chgCoeff] and attribute setters (RHS, bounds) are cheap in-place mutations that do
 * **not** trigger a structural rebuild, so they are the right tool for per-iteration updates.
