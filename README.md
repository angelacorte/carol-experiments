# CAROL: Coordinated Aggregate Robotics with Online control Lyapunov and barrier functions

**CAROL** is a fully distributed, multi-robot control framework written in Kotlin. It bridges the gap between **Aggregate Programming** (via the Collektive framework) and **Optimization-based Control** using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).

By leveraging the **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)**, CAROL allows a swarm of robots to negotiate safe and optimal trajectories in a fully distributed manner, ensuring goal convergence, obstacle avoidance, inter-robot collision avoidance, and communication range maintenance.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Distributed Consensus (ADMM)**: Solves coupled multi-agent Quadratic Programs (QPs) using local and pairwise micro-iterations, eliminating the need for a central coordinator.
* **Safety & Connectivity (CBFs)**:
    * *Obstacle Avoidance*: Hard constraints to dodge static environment hazards.
    * *Collision Avoidance*: Hard constraints to maintain a minimum safe distance between neighbors.
    * *Communication Range*: Soft constraints (with L1 penalty) to maintain network connectivity without causing solver freezing when physical boundaries force a split.
* **Goal Tracking (CLFs)**: Proportional nominal controllers paired with CLFs to ensure asymptotic convergence to target destinations.
* **Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) Discretization**: Exact discrete-time robustification of continuous-time dynamics, ensuring the QP solver remains strictly affine and mathematically sound.
* **Stateless Architecture**: Completely thread-safe and immutable constraint definitions, ready for parallelized processing and coroutines.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The codebase is engineered following strict Separation of Concerns (SoC) and SOLID principles:

* `it.unibo.collektive.admm` — The core consensus algorithm. Contains the local and pairwise QP problem formulations, objective penalties, and residual tracking.
* `it.unibo.collektive.control` — Theoretical control models.
    * `clf/` and `cbf/`: Stateless interfaces and implementations of specific Lyapunov and Barrier functions.
    * `NominalController.kt`: Pluggable strategies for unconstrained target tracking.
* `it.unibo.collektive.solver.gurobi` — The mathematical engine. Wraps the Gurobi Java API to build expressions, variables, and handle license discovery and debug logging.
* `it.unibo.collektive.model` — Pure domain models (`Robot`, `Target`, `Obstacle`, `SpeedControl2D`).
* `it.unibo.collektive.mathutils` — Linear algebra and vector operations.
* `it.unibo.collektive.alchemist` — The integration layer connecting the mathematical solver to the Alchemist Simulator (sensors, environment operators).

## 🚀 Prerequisites

To run the simulation, you will need:
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher (17+ recommended).
2. **Gurobi Optimizer**: A working installation of Gurobi.
3. **Gurobi License**: You must possess a valid `gurobi.lic` file.
    * The system will automatically search for it in `~/Library/gurobi/gurobi.lic` (macOS default).
    * Alternatively, you can set the `GRB_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable or JVM system property pointing to the absolute path of your license file.

## 🛠️ Configuration and Usage

The simulation scenarios are defined using YAML configuration files processed by the Alchemist simulator.

### Tuning the Simulation (`carolADMM.yml`)
You can tweak the environment and solver settings directly from the YAML file:
```yaml
variables:
  maxCommDistance: 9.0
  robotSafeMargin: 0.5
  robotMaxSpeed: 2.0
  primalTolerance: 1e-2
  dualTolerance: 1e-2
  maxIterations: 50
  timeDistribution: 100.0 # 100 Hz control loop
```

### Running the Simulation

1. Ensure your Gurobi license is properly set up.
2. Build the project using Gradle: ```./gradlew build```
3. Run the Alchemist simulation with the specified YAML configuration: ```./gradlew runCarolADMM```

## 🧪 Mathematical Details
This framework implements the mathematical formulations described in the reference documentation.
S oft constraints (like maintaining communication) are handled using an L1 penalty mechanism in the objective function. 
This allows the QP solver to gracefully degrade connectivity to prioritize physical survival (obstacle/collision avoidance) 
without causing an explosion in the objective cost, maintaining ADMM convergence stability.
